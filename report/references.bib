 abstract = {Different countries may have a common interest in the
                  endeavor to build strong clusters or to boost the
                  cooperation between clusters within a specific
                  region. They can use the same specialized research
                  infrastructure and same testing capabilities; they
                  can also encourage cross-border transfer of
                  knowledge. This requires designing a common
                  long-term strategy to facilitate the development of
                  strong global clusters. In early stages, this type
                  of cooperation is limited to cross-border
                  cooperation between regions with common cultural
                  identity, such as the Baltic Sea Region and Central
                  Europe. We can conclude that, although transnational
                  clusters would be a great benefit, it is unlikely
                  that they occur spontaneously. The European
                  Community facilitates transnational cluster
                  cooperation, through different tools that could
                  offer greater benefits. In this respect, it is
                  necessary to address and develop the strategic
                  dimension of transnational cluster cooperation. We
                  tried to emphasize this in our paper, considering
                  countries between two important water borders,
                  namely the Adriatic Sea and the Danube.},

                  tie strength on the performance of ventures in the
                  context of the transnational entrepreneur
                  (TE). Network range facilitates access to a broad
                  set of knowledge and resources; however these
                  resources may be activated only in the presence of
                  strong ties. Alternatively, a network heavy in
                  strong ties provides reliable connections, but a
                  lack of range can lead to network closure. Using a
                  sample of 452 TE ventures, we find that tie strength
                  enhances venture performance, but network range does
                  not have a significant effect. Furthermore, taken
                  together, tie strength and network range
                  significantly enhance TE venture
                  performance. Supermodularity and linear restriction
                  tests indicate asymmetric complementarity between
                  network range and tie strength. Tie strength is a
                  critical input and network range plays a supporting
                  role in a TE's venture performance. Copyright (C)

 abstract = {In recent years, entrepreneurship among migrant
                  minorities has increased significantly in the
                  Netherlands. This paper addresses the key factors
                  determining the economic position of migrant
                  entrepreneurs in the urban economy in the
                  Netherlands, with an application to Amsterdam. So
                  far, little information on success conditions for
                  migrant entrepreneurship is available, while
                  quantitative knowledge on critical success factors
                  (CSFs) is lagging far behind the rapid growth of
                  migrant entrepreneurs in big cities like
                  Amsterdam. The present study serves to fill this
                  knowledge gap, by paying attention to the
                  entrepreneurial behaviour of migrants, the role of
                  their social networks, and the innovative potential
                  of new growth markets in a modern city. In order to
                  provide a solid assessment of CSFs for migrant
                  entrepreneurs, and to understand business
                  performance in a competitive urban environment, this
                  study will investigate the entrepreneurial behaviour
                  of migrants in Dutch cities from a micro-economic
                  perspective. Due insight into individual
                  entrepreneurial behaviour of migrants is needed to
                  develop an urban business culture in which migrants
                  are no longer a source of problems but of great
                  socio-economic opportunities, both for the migrant
                  groups concerned and the vitality of cities. Our
                  research employs a comparative statistical analysis
                  of empirical findings in the city of Amsterdam in
                  order to map out opportunities, success conditions
                  and bottlenecks for migrant entrepreneurs. Given our
                  largely categorical (i.e. qualitative or soft)
                  database, we will employ a qualitative causal
                  pattern recognition technique, namely, rough set
                  analysis, to systematically assess the conditions
                  for successful entrepreneurship of migrants.},

 abstract = {Transnationalism was initially proposed as an alternative
                  perspective to the assimilation and integration
                  frameworks, which tend to prioritize the
                  nation-state over transnational
                  mobility. Policy-makers in host societies usually
                  regard transnational migrants' close linkages with
                  the homeland as a sign of social and political
                  detachment, thus reducing their contributions to the
                  host land. Findings from our research on Chinese new
                  immigrant entrepreneurs in Singapore suggest the
                  simultaneous embeddedness of immigrants into two or
                  more nation-states and geopolitical
                  spheres. However, integration in Singapore and

                  zero-sum game. Our evidence suggests that
                  transnationalism and integration have been construed
                  as a mutually reinforcing strategy in new

                  survey designed explicitly for this purpose and
                  conducted among selected Latin immigrant groups in
                  the United States. Although immigrant
                  transnationalism has received little attention in
                  the mainstream sociological literature so far, it
                  has the potential of altering the character of the
                  new ethnic communities spawned by contemporary
                  immigration. The empirical existence of
                  transnationalism is examined on the basis of
                  discriminant functions of migrant characteristics,
                  and the relative probabilities of engaging in these
                  kinds of activities is established based on
                  hypotheses drawn from the literature. Implications
                  for the sociology of immigration as well as for
                  broader sociological theories of the economy are
                  discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of

@article{Miera.2008,
 abstract = {This paper explores the structure and strategies of
                  Polish migrant entrepreneurship in Berlin in the
                  1990s, drawing on statistical data, in-depth
                  interviews and a comparison to Turkish
                  entrepreneurship in Berlin. Existing research on the
                  entrepreneurial activity of migrants and ethnic
                  minorities tends to focus on processes observed
                  solely within specific places in the country of
                  immigration. I argue that further insights into the
                  dynamics of 'ethnic entrepreneurship' are enabled by
                  introducing the concept of transnational social
                  space to the 'mixed embeddedness' perspective on
                  ethnic business. This approach may explain the early
                  orientation towards an open and transnational market
                  among Polish entrepreneurs in comparison to the more
                  local orientation of the 'ethnic community' in the
                  first period of Turkish entrepreneurship. Four main
                  entrepreneurial strategies of migrants from Poland
                  can be observed: first, utilising a high degree of
                  personal mobility and the differences in purchasing
                  power between Germany and Poland in cross-border
                  trade; second, the recruitment of 'transnational
                  workers'; third, referring to the 'Polish community'
                  as a market; and fourth, opening branches in Poland
                  of businesses initiated and based in Germany. These
                  strategies point to the relevance of transnational
                  social networks and mobility in the context of
                  national and transnational market conditions and
                  politico-institutional frameworks.},

@article{Urban.2011,
 abstract = {Orientation: Researching entrepreneurship using a network
                  perspective is important, as social networks are
                  assets for small business owners struggling to
                  survive in competitive markets. Research purpose:
                  The research question of this study has focused on
                  what we can learn about entrepreneurial networking,
                  considering that there is an under-explored and
                  unarticulated set of networking principles and
                  practices which have not been previously analysed in
                  terms of a multiethnic country context. Motivation
                  for the study: Often the lack of network use is
                  reported as a feature of entrepreneurs, who have
                  less opportunity to utilise formal social capital
                  features. Social networks provided by extended
                  family, community-based or organisational
                  relationships are often theorised to supplement the
                  effects of education, experience and financial
                  capital. Research design, approach and method: Based
                  on hypothesised differences in networking ties,
                  network assistance and support relationships, a
                  survey was used to collect data on quantitative
                  measures. Descriptive statistics were calculated and
                  differential tests were conducted to test the
                  hypotheses. Main findings: Results indicate that
                  entrepreneurial networking is largely independent on
                  group composition. Generally at least some aspects
                  of networking are generic and as a consequence, a
                  more integrated view of networking can be
                  adopted. Practical/managerial implications: The
                  practical value of the present study points to
                  several areas of interest to entrepreneurs, policy
                  makers and educators, through demonstrating the
                  multifaceted nature of entrepreneurial networks for
                  different groups and their explanatory potential in
                  understanding networking. Contribution/value-add:
                  Despite the importance of entrepreneurial
                  networking, little empirical or theoretical research
                  has examined the dynamics of networking in a
                  developing country context such as South Africa,
                  which has lower than expected total entrepreneurship
                  activity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of SAJIP:

                  immigrant entrepreneurs identify opportunities to
                  conduct business in foreign markets, this article
                  explores how Italian immigrant entrepreneurs in
                  Australia identify such opportunities. Relying on
                  social network theory (Patel and Conklin, 2009),
                  international business research indicates that
                  social ties, including kinship and ethnic ties,
                  facilitate the flow of information that enables
                  entrepreneurs to identify opportunities (Ellis,
                  2011; Hayton, Chandler and DeTienne, 2011). This
                  study finds that the Italian immigrant entrepreneurs
                  prefer to receive information about business
                  opportunities from trusting, social ties,
                  particularly country of origin (Italy) regional
                  based ethnic ties, rather kinship ties for fear of
                  damaging the relationship. However both first and
                  second generation immigrants do use kinship ties to
                  gain knowledge about Italian market
                  conditions. Implications for policy and practice,
                  limitations of the study and ideas for future

                  available information, to study the migratory
                  behavior of the very rich. Billionaires are more

                  entrepreneurs' internationalization strategies. Four
                  case studies reveal the ways in which transnational

                  frameworks and social capital theory to explain the
                  formation and management of entrepreneurial ventures
                  among immigrant communities. The varying rates of
                  venture formation and performance among different
                  ethnic groups points to the role that the different
                  dimensions of culture play in how immigrants use
                  their social networks to start such firms. We use
                  the specific example of the Indian and Chinese
                  communities in the US to demonstrate this effect and
                  explain how businesses created by members of these
                  communities could have potentially different ways of
                  starting and operating that can be directly traced
                  to the differences in cultural orientation of their
                  owners. What emerges can be summarized as: (a)
                  different immigrant communities have different ways
                  of accumulating and using social capital in starting
                  and managing their ethnic ventures; (b) these
                  dissimilarities manifest themselves in variations in
                  the motives for forming these ventures, human
                  resource practices and termination rates; and (c)
                  that these variations can partly be explained by the

 abstract = {International education is a fundamentally, transnational
                  project. It relies on the movement of individuals or
                  knowledge across national borders, disturbs the
                  centrality of the nation-slate in educational
                  reproduction, and is facilitated by economic and
                  social networks that act as bridges between
                  countries of origin and education. In this article,
                  I address this latter point through reference to
                  research conducted with South Korean international
                  students in Auckland, New Zealand. In particular, I
                  discuss the emergence of transnational social and
                  economic activities that are facilitating the
                  movement of international students from South Korea
                  to Auckland - activities that might usefully be
                  understood as forming 'bridges to learning'. These
                  include the activities of education agencies,
                  immigrant entrepreneurs and the interpersonal
                  relationships with which many students engage in the
                  negotiation of their transnational lives. In a
                  broader sense I illustrate how the emerging
                  mobilities of international students cannot be
                  viewed as independent of other phenomena but must be
                  seen as embedded within transnational processes that
                  take place at different geographic and social
                  scales.},

 abstract = {In the globalizing knowledge economy firms have become
                  less reliant on local production and market networks
                  and increasingly expand their reach to an
                  international or global scale. The argument of this
                  paper suggests that this has given rise to distinct
                  geographies of knowledge transfers over distance,
                  which rely on periodic or regular temporary
                  face-to-face contacts. While some of these settings
                  of temporary knowledge transfers have existed for a
                  long time, they are now being intensively applied
                  throughout the economy. In this paper we develop a
                  typology of these geographies based on three
                  dimensions that characterize the conditions for
                  knowledge exchange: (i) framing, (ii) cognitive
                  focus and goals, and (iii) trust and risks
                  involved. Based on these variables, we identify
                  three configurations and eight subcategories of
                  knowledge transfers that build upon temporary
                  face-to-face interaction, classified as (1)
                  international community gatherings, (2)
                  international business travel, and (3) transnational
                  network relations. Systematic comparison reveals
                  that with growing uncertainty in economic
                  interaction and with increasing commitment between
                  the agents, trust-based linkages tend to become more
                  important, and the number of interacting agents
                  declines, while the frequency of temporary
                  face-to-face meetings increases.},

                  to generate an entrepreneurial gain (positive impact
                  on home and host countries). We consider that
                  positive reasons for emigrating can increase
                  transnational entrepreneurship and mutual benefits
                  for both societies. To test this hypothesis we
                  present a model using Structural Equation Modelling
                  (SEM). This model explains the relations between
                  motivations, cultural similarities, institutions and

                  on their ethnic identity to gain skills and
                  capabilities that enable them to operate in a new
                  and strange environment. We explore the mechanisms
                  by which Bulgarian entrepreneurs in London use their
                  ethnic identity to develop competitive advantage and
                  business contacts. We find that the entrepreneurs
                  studied gain access to a diaspora network, which
                  enables them to develop essential business
                  capabilities and integrate knowledge from both home
                  and host country environments. The diaspora
                  community possesses a collective asset (transactive
                  memory) that allows its members to remove
                  competition from the interfirm level to the network
                  level (i.e., diaspora networks vs. networks of
                  native businesspeople). Additionally, the cultural
                  identity and networks to which community members
                  have access provide bridging capabilities that allow
                  diaspora businesspeople to make links to host
                  country business partners and thus embed themselves
                  in the host country environment. Thus, this paper
                  adds to the growing body of work showing how
                  foreignness can serve as an asset in addition to its

                  performance has seldom been empirically investigated
                  for SMEs, much less in multiple-country
                  settings. Given the existing body of knowledge on
                  this important topic, the question of why some

                  networks in the innovation process. We propose a

                  framework to advance the study of Transnational
                  Entrepreneurship (TE), which refers to the processes
                  of creating and growing new business ventures across
                  national boundaries by social actors. We first
                  examine relevant research literatures and
                  theoretical perspectives and identify the
                  limitations of each in analyzing the process of
                  TE. We then introduce a new theoretical lens for
                  studying TE that is grounded in the theory of
                  practice and the concept of ``habitus'', which
                  refers to aspects of culture that are anchored in
                  the body of daily practices of individuals, groups,
                  societies, and nations. Our proposed analytical
                  framework views TE as a social realm of immigrants

                  how this framework integrates perspectives that
                  focus on actors' motivation and behavior, cultural
                  values and norms, institutional fields, political
                  meaning and consequences, and social capital and
                  network formation. We conclude by developing
                  theoretical propositions and recommendations for
                  future research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of

 abstract = {This study focuses on start-up entrepreneurs on the
                  movein coordination with an array of other actorsas
                  they weave and are woven into transnational
                  networks. Central to this study is a shift from
                  activity to mobility systems. Building on technical
                  communication scholarship, the frame integrates
                  actor networks and activity theory
                  knotworks. Disrupting workplace and national
                  container models (methodological nationalism), the
                  analysis is grounded in a study of Israeli start-up
                  entrepreneurs. Dubbed the Start-Up Nation, Israel
                  contains more start-ups per capita than any other
                  country in the world, with its high-tech industry
                  made up of a dense ecosystem of conferences,
                  accelerators, meetups, social media, and coworking
                  spaces. Tracing actants' trajectories across this
                  social field, the author argues for a
                  conceptualization of entrepreneurs as knotworkers
                  who mobilize genres, modes, languages, and spaces.},

 abstract = {Access to resources is a key challenge facing
                  entrepreneurs during early venture develop-
                  ment. Entrepreneurs’ networks serve as a principal
                  means of identifying and acquiring needed
                  resources. However, different stages of venture
                  development may address different resource
                  dependencies, suggesting entrepreneurs’ networks may
                  need to change to meet changing resource
                  requirements. By employing network theory and
                  resource-dependence theory, we investigate how
                  entrepreneurs may use networks to address changing
                  resource needs during early venture
                  development. Results illustrate how structural
                  characteristics of entrepreneurs’ networks at
                  venture launch are associated with network structure
                  and content in early venture development in ways
                  that may promote access to newly needed resources.},
