Deductive was chosen because.

Without directly observing Transnational Entrepreneurs in their own environments throughout many longitudinal studies, while simultaneously observing an equally large control group over the course of years, it is impossible to witness Transnational Diffusion.
\\
As such as a secondary method of observation was chosen- Twitter. Through Twitter's public API we are able to get a host of publicly available data about any given User.

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|created_at|: User account creation date
\item \verb|description|: User account description
\item \verb|favorites_count|: How many tweets has the User favorited.
\item \verb|followers_count|: How many followers does the User have
\item \verb|friends_count|: How many users does the User follow
\item \verb|id_str|: What is the User's unique id
\item \verb|lang|: What language has the User set
\item \verb|listed_count|: How many public lists is the User a member of
\item \verb|location|: Where is the User located
\item \verb|name|: What is the User's name
\item \verb|screen_name|: What is the User's screen name
\item \verb|statuses_count|: How many stasuses has the User posted
\item \verb|time_zone|: What is the time zone of the user
\item \verb|utc_offset|: What is the UTC (coordinated universal time) offset of the user
\item \verb|verified|: Has the User submitted proof to Twitter of their identity
\end{itemize}

We are also able to get their statuses which will later be useful for tracking Transnational Diffusion through the Twitter network.

\subsection{The Root Node}
The study that we have done may be replicated in any given country given the following process:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Select a city within the country you are interested in studying, preferably a startup hub
\item Select a startup incubator or co-working space in the city of interest
\item Find the Twitter account of the selected incubator or co-working space
\end{enumerate}
