Without directly observing Transnational Entrepreneurs in their own environments throughout many longitudinal studies, while simultaneously observing an equally large control group over the course of years, it is impossible to witness Transnational Diffusion.
\\
As such as a secondary method of observation was chosen- Twitter. Through Twitter's public API we are able to get a host of publicly available data about any given User.

Deductive was chosen because.

% High Level Overview

Twitter affords us a large amount of publicly available data. The following are the fields that we may extract for any given Twitter user.

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|created_at|: User account creation date
\item \verb|description|: User account description
\item \verb|favorites_count|: How many tweets has the User favorited.
\item \verb|followers_count|: How many followers does the User have
\item \verb|friends_count|: How many users does the User follow
\item \verb|id_str|: What is the User's unique id
\item \verb|lang|: What language has the User set
\item \verb|listed_count|: How many public lists is the User a member of
\item \verb|location|: Where is the User located
\item \verb|name|: What is the User's name
\item \verb|screen_name|: What is the User's screen name
\item \verb|statuses_count|: How many stasuses has the User posted
\item \verb|time_zone|: What is the time zone of the user
\item \verb|utc_offset|: What is the UTC (coordinated universal time) offset of the user
\item \verb|verified|: Has the User submitted proof to Twitter of their identity
\end{itemize}

We are also able to get all of their relationships, all of their friends and followers. Finally, we can get their latest 200 statuses which are useful for tracking Transnational Diffusion through a Twitter network.

\subsection{The Root Node}
The study that we have done may be replicated in any given country given the following process:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Select a city within the country you are interested in studying, preferably a startup hub
\item Select a startup incubator or co-working space in the city of interest
\item Find the Twitter account of the selected incubator or co-working space
\end{enumerate}

The Twitter account that you find in the third step will represent your network root.

\subsection{Root network Extraction}
After identifying a Twitter User as your Root node, the program will extract a group of follower's from your Root node. These are your Root node's 1st degree network, or rather, an incomplete ego-centric network. This group of followers represent candidates for Transnational Entrepreneurs, we know they are likely Entreprenuers in the city that we are interested in, in order to determine whether they are the users that we are looking for, we will perform a set of filters on them.

\subsection{Filter Level 0}
Filter level 0 is responsible for filtering the Root network's ego centric users to see whether they are of interest. We check two things here.

\begin{itemize}
\item Is the User from Berlin?
\item Is the User a human?
\end{itemize}

The way we determine whether the User is from Berlin is largely by relying on their time zone settings. We found that many people set their language, or their city to whatever they would like, but the timezone, often automatically set by the computer is a good indicator of the user's actual locale. Either way, going with any one of the attributes is not a completley valid way to ensure that a given user says where they actually are, all information is subject to what the user wishes to input.
\\
The second criteria is a little bit more difficult to discern. It is not always possible to tell apart a human from a robot or organization. In order to keep things as simple as possible, we looked for all user's with names that existed within a census of known names. This is again not a foolproof way of filtering users as robots or not, but it is computationally cheap and allowed us to quickly move on to our next stage of filtering.

\subsection{Filter Level 1}
Filter level 1 is the part of the filtering process in which we determine whether a user is largely of interest to us, are we going to gather their ego centric network. The reason that we must assess this at this stage is because we are rate limited in how many API calls we may make to the Twitter API for a given time frame (please see the appendix for details). In order to assess whether a candidate is therefore a transnational entrepreneur without pulling their whole network, we pull a sample of their friends.
\\
If we find that the sample distribution is valid, then we will mark them as filtered and move on to processing them in the next stage. The distribution ratio of a valid transnational is therefore that their top two most common nationalaties in their network must be more than \verb|50%| of their network and that their top two most common nationalities may not differ by more than \verb|80%|.

\subsection{Transnational Entrepreneur Ego Network Extraction}
Following the selection of a set of individuals that we are interested in we begin the extraction process. We iterate through every Transnational Entrepreneur candidate and collect a limited network of their friends and followers. For our initial study, we limited this to 10,000 friends and 10,000 followers each for a given Transnational Entrepreneur.
