The results of our study show that transnational diffusion, on Twitter
specifically, is sparse. This may not hold true for other digital
networks. This may be due to the format, culture, population, or any
other variables which effect the type and frequency of messages
expressed on Twitter.

Despite the large data set, the amount of instances of Transnational
Diffusion we were able to observe were insufficient to draw together
any conclusions. There is not enough data to say with any conclusivity
how the distribution of the Transnational's network will affect the
frequency of transnational diffusion.
