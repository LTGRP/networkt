First and foremost I would like to thank my friends and my family for supporting me throughout my life.
\\
\\
I would also like to dedicate a large portion of my work to the Kivy community who were exceptionally helpful throughout the entire development process. They provided me with Python support, support with their framework, and were always present to bounce ideas off of. 
\\
\\
Additionally, I would like to thank the Python community as a whole for providing a set of tools that enabled me to rapidly prototype and test ideas that would have taken far longer in any other language or environment.
\\
\\
Finally, I would like to thank all of the humans who came before and developed all of the technologies and things I have built upon, because without their collective dedication and development, this project would have simply not been possible.
